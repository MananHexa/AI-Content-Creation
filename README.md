3. **User Bio (THIRD PRIORITY)** - Uses profile information if no recent posts
4. **Industry-Relevant Trending Topics (LOWEST PRIORITY)** - Automatically uses industry-relevant trending topics as final fallback

**Industry Agnostic**: Whether you're in IT, healthcare, finance, education, retail, or any other industry, the AI will automatically detect your field and generate relevant content!
